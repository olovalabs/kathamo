## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Added native provider/model discovery for all 67 OMP README integrations while preserving existing provider/model identities: 104 catalog providers, 6,279 frozen model entries, and real local/account model discovery. Chat selection excludes non-chat task models without deleting their metadata.
- Added native Rust API-key and browser/device OAuth flows, request-time renewal and vendor-specific inference transports; providers supporting both methods expose both. No OMP executable or runtime is required.
- Added an auto-focused, theme-matched model search field with a search icon, clear button, case-insensitive model/provider filtering, and a no-results state.
- Antigravity model catalog now exposes Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Gemini 3.5/3.1/2.5 Flash-Lite alongside Gemini 3.8 Flash, with the same Fast/Deep reasoning controls, so chat can use a responsive route while the 3.8 Cloud Code endpoint is congested.
- Native OMP approval, selection, confirmation, text/editor and structured-question dialogs with cancellation, expiry and stale-session guards; interaction responses stay out of transcript persistence.
- Explicit, confirmed workspace-scoped OMP trust: protected `write` by default, opt-in `yolo`, canonical-path checks and safe deferred authority changes during active turns.
- Per-pane explicit OMP reasoning effort without changing models, alongside Fast/Deep presets.
- Metadata-only OMP provider/argument/tool-cycle timings and `scripts/bench-omp-tools.py`, an isolated loopback fixture exercising real batched reads, local shell steps and approvals.
- Center and enlarge the Kathamo wordmark on the empty Agent page; show only the selected model beneath it.
- Zed-style per-platform app data directories (`src/paths.rs`): workspace, scrollback, agent conversations and backups under the OS data dir; user settings under the OS config dir. Missing folders are created on launch.
- Full session restoration: projects, sidebar tabs, nested split layouts, focused pane, per-pane working directories, tab titles/logos, input drafts, command history, sidebar width and window geometry are saved and restored after a restart.
- Terminal scrollback is snapshotted per pane and seeded above the fresh shell prompt on restore.
- Append-only agent conversation history in `conversations/<pane-uid>/*.jsonl`; restored transcripts match the previous UI, and rpi conversations resume via `rpi --session <id>` on the next prompt (OMP restores the transcript only).
- **Settings → Data & Sessions** section: shows the data folder, opens it in the file manager, toggles session/scrollback/agent-history restore, and clears saved sessions.
- Synchronous save on window close and app quit, plus a 30-second autosave for crash recovery.
- One-time migration from the legacy `workspace.json` (including the old Markup location) with a timestamped backup in `<data>/backups/`.
- `KATHAMO_DATA_DIR` and `KATHAMO_DISABLE_RESTORE` environment overrides.
- Render streamed agent replies as Markdown, including headings, lists, links, and syntax-highlighted code blocks.
- Display all tool call details in rich Zed-style cards showing tool badges, call ID tags, inline argument summaries, status indicators, line counts, pretty-printed arguments with a copy button, and bounded scrollable outputs with one-click copying.
- Collapsible thinking accordions that display live streaming thoughts while reasoning and automatically fold into compact headers when the response begins.
- Dynamic autoscrolling for agent chat that stays pinned to the bottom across streaming updates and asynchronous Markdown layout changes, with smart user scroll-lock and a floating "Scroll to bottom" button.
- Pre-warm agent bridge processes in the background upon switching to Agent mode or selecting a model.
- Enable RPC idle cache warming and default to Fast mode (`low` thinking effort) for rapid responses, with an interactive `⚡ Fast`/`🧠 Deep` toggle and `/fast` / `/thinking` slash commands.
- Model selector for rpi and Google Antigravity, with a persistent default provider/model for new panes.
- Polish the agent composer with a contextual placeholder, a roomier input, hidden key hints, a pill-styled model picker, and the same overall height as the terminal composer.
- Google Antigravity OAuth and model selection in `/auth`, with separate native chat sessions using the installed oh-my-pi agent.
- `/auth` in agent mode opens provider discovery and authentication with masked input and rpi-managed credentials.
- Native per-pane pi-rust agent chat with streamed replies, tool activity, cancellation, and a terminal/agent switch. Requires a separately installed and configured `rpi` executable.
- **Kathamo input editor**:
  - Shell history from zsh, bash, and fish history files, merged with the session's own commands for Up/Down recall and ghost suggestions.
  - Context-aware completion menu (Tab) for `PATH` commands, shell builtins, files and directories, git branches, and history — with arrow navigation and click-to-accept.
  - Inline ghost suggestion from history, accepted with Right or Tab.
  - Ctrl+R reverse history search palette with live filtering.
  - Readline editing in the input bar: Ctrl+A/E, Ctrl+U/K/W, Alt+B/F, Ctrl+P/N, Shift+Enter newline, and Ctrl+C interrupt.
  - Multi-line programmatic edits now leave the cursor at the end of the line.

### Changed
- Reworked shell streaming with bounded asynchronous capture, complete sanitized logs, 16 ms quiet-period checkpoints, concurrent stdin/stdout/stderr/status handling, and reliable cancellation/drop cleanup. Removed redundant timeout padding and batched log appends.
- Moved PTY setup, input, resize and teardown off GPUI; added bounded FIFO input with physical-write receipts, visible refusal/failure handling, real child exit status and cooperative parsing/restoration.
- Bounded native/RPC event delivery, prompt admission and transcript persistence; coalesce identified snapshots before projection, preserve lifecycle events, resignal fair UI drains, and report persistence overload.
- Replaced the embedded `grep` tool's custom matching loop and full-tree snapshot with ripgrep's Rust matcher/searcher: streaming native file reads, incremental ignore-aware traversal, early result/output limits, binary detection and merged context windows. No external `rg` executable is required.
- Hide anonymous/keyless provider entries from the authentication list without removing their backend support.
- Restyled model selection with compact rows, trailing selection checks, free-model badges, and a two-column provider card section matching the OpenCode reference. Model selection and provider authentication now share one narrower 520px modal with theme-derived backgrounds, text, borders, and hover colors, plus consistent close and back navigation.
- Compact streamed OMP text, worker deltas and cumulative tool snapshots before enqueue with bounded backpressure, preserving tool lifecycle order and complete results.
- Favor independent read/search batches and deterministic multi-step local execution while keeping OMP's shared/exclusive scheduling and full tool/extension discovery.
- Redesigned the project sidebar with compact, smaller session titles without per-session logos, reduced left padding, subtle selection styling, and project/session remove buttons shown only while hovering their row. Each project initially shows five sessions; each "Show more" click reveals ten more, and "Show less" collapses back to five. Expanded lists scroll while the toolbar and Settings footer remain visible.
- Poll active agent streams at approximately frame cadence while retaining the lower idle polling rate.
- Migrated the application and terminal renderer to GPUI Fast.
- The terminal displays a plain grid without block UI. The Warp-style bottom input is always available when the shell is idle and temporarily hides while a command runs or the alternate screen is active.
- Removed the bottom input toggle; a previously saved `bottom_input` preference no longer disables the input.

### Fixed
- Fix duplicate Antigravity model-route registration causing false ambiguous-model errors; host-declared transports now replace bundled routes for the same model identity.
- Keep Markdown agent replies updating during continuous streams and reduce OMP streaming payloads.
- Display streamed agent thinking text instead of leaving the chat blank while a model is reasoning.
- `/model` opens model selection instead of authentication; selecting an already authenticated provider no longer starts another login.
- System appearance changes now update existing terminal panes and application chrome; theme changes preserve the configured component fonts.
- Notify compatible running terminal applications when the terminal palette changes, so their light and dark themes can update without a restart.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-11-01

### Added
- **GPU-Accelerated Terminal Emulator**:
  - Embedded `terminal` component utilizing GPUI and `alacritty_terminal` for VTE parsing.
  - High-performance 1 ms stream coalescing with a 128 KiB parse cap to preserve UI framerates at high log throughput.
  - Full support for ANSI colors (standard 16, 256-color, 24-bit RGB), text styles, and embedded Mononoki monospace fonts.
  - OSC 52 clipboard copy and paste integration.
- **Agent Attention & Status System**:
  - Parity with the Kathamo agent attention model (`blocked > done > working > idle`).
  - Latching completion tracking: agent runs that finish in an unviewed tab switch to `done` and alert the user; focusing the tab clears status to `idle`.
  - Audio chimes and desktop toast notifications for blocked queries and missed finishes (`KATHAMO_NO_SOUND=1` support).
  - Sub-agent hierarchy support: child sessions with `agent_id` nest neatly under parent sessions without duplicate notifications.
- **Multi-Project Workspace Management**:
  - Collapsible project folders in the sidebar grouping related terminal sessions.
  - Workspace state persistence to `~/.config/kathamo/workspace.json`, automatically restoring open projects and session trees across application restarts.
  - Project-level actions for adding sessions and opening directories.
- **Native Agent Integrations & CLI**:
  - One-command setup CLI (`kathamo integration setup`, `status`, `doctor`, `remove`).
  - Native hook support for Claude Code, Codex, Pi, OMP, OpenCode v2, and Command Code (Kathamo compatibility protocol).
  - Terminal CLI commands: `kathamo report`, `kathamo skill`, `kathamo status`, `kathamo pane`, and OSC 7501 ANSI sequence reporting.
- **Desktop Integration**:
  - Custom title bar and window decoration controls.
  - Automatic Linux desktop entry (`.desktop`) creation in `~/.local/share/applications/`.
  - Taskbar icon support for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
  - GitHub Dark palette theme.
