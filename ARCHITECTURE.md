# Kathamo Architecture

This document describes the architectural design, core subsystems, and data flows of the **Kathamo** terminal emulator.

---

## 1. System Overview

Kathamo is designed around three primary concerns:
1. **High-throughput, GPU-accelerated terminal emulation** using GPUI and Alacritty's VTE parser.
2. **Autonomous AI agent state tracking** via an IPC status bus and the Kathamo attention protocol.
3. **Multi-project workspace management** with persistent project-scoped terminal sessions.

## 2. Core Subsystems

### 2.1 Terminal Emulation (`terminal`)

The terminal widget is implemented in the `terminal` sub-crate:
- **PTY Management**: Spawns user shells using `portable-pty` with asynchronous read and write loops.
- **Throughput Protection**: Uncontrolled terminal streams (e.g., fast compiler output or large file dumps) can overwhelm desktop UI threads. Kathamo employs an adaptive **1 ms stream coalescer** and a **128 KiB parse cap per frame**. This ensures UI responsiveness even at stream rates exceeding 40 MB/s.
- **Rendering**: Terminal glyphs and styling (bold, italic, 24-bit RGB true color) are painted directly via GPUI primitives using embedded monospace fonts (`Mononoki`).

### 2.2 Status Bus & IPC (`src/status_bus.rs`, `src/status.rs`)

The status bus receives events from running agent processes:
- **Unix Domain Socket**: Kathamo binds a private per-user Unix socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/kathamo-status.sock` (or `/tmp/kathamo-$UID/status.sock`).
- **Generation Authentication**: Each terminal pane receives a unique `pane_generation` token in its environment (`KATHAMO_PANE_GENERATION`). The status bus verifies this token to reject stale or unauthorized events from old processes.
- **OSC 7501 Fallback**: For environments where local sockets cannot be bridged, agents can emit custom OSC 7501 ANSI sequences directly to stdout (`\x1b]7501;state=working...\x1b\`).

### 2.3 Agent Attention Model (`src/attention.rs`)

Kathamo implements the agent attention model to eliminate notification fatigue while guaranteeing critical tasks are never missed:
- **Attention Hierarchy**:
  $$\text{Blocked} > \text{Done} > \text{Working} > \text{Idle}$$
  - `Error` ranks as `Blocked`.
  - `Unknown` and `Active` rank as `Idle`.
- **Unviewed Completion Latching**:
  - When an agent finishes while focused and visible, its status transitions directly to `idle`/`active` without ringing bells.
  - When an agent finishes while unfocused or in a hidden tab, its status latches to `done`. An audio alert plays and a notification toast appears. Switching to that tab automatically clears the status to `idle`.
- **Sub-Agent / Worker Hierarchy**: Child sessions (reporting an `agent_id`) are grouped under their parent session without raising independent notifications or corrupting the parent's status.

### 2.4 Agent Integrations (`src/integrations.rs`, `src/agent_rules.rs`)

Kathamo provides automated one-command setup for developer agent ecosystems:
- **Claude Code**: Hooks registered into `~/.claude/settings.json`.
- **Codex**: Hooks registered into `~/.codex/hooks.json`.
- **Pi & OMP**: Extension modules placed into dedicated agent directories.
- **OpenCode**: Upstream V2 TUI session listener plugin (`assets/integrations/opencode-tui.js`).
- **Command Code**: Direct native compatibility via socket environment variables (`KATHAMO_SOCKET_PATH`, `KATHAMO_PANE_ID`).
- **Screen Detection**: Embedded TOML manifests (`assets/agent-detection/*.toml`) evaluate regex patterns on visible terminal screen buffers to detect agent activity without requiring agent configuration.

### 2.5 Workspace State & Persistence (`src/workspace_state.rs`, `src/settings.rs`, `src/conversations.rs`)

Kathamo follows Zed's per-platform directory convention (`src/paths.rs`):

| Platform | Data dir | Config dir |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `$XDG_DATA_HOME/kathamo` (`~/.local/share/kathamo`) | `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kathamo` (`~/.config/kathamo`) |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Kathamo` | `~/.config/kathamo` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Kathamo` | `%APPDATA%\Kathamo` |

```
<data>/
  workspace.json              # v2: projects -> sessions (tabs) -> panes + split tree
  sessions/<pane-uid>.txt     # captured terminal output per pane (2 000 lines / 256 KiB cap)
  conversations/<pane-uid>/   # append-only JSONL agent transcripts
  backups/                    # pre-v2 workspace backups
  logs/
<config>/settings.json        # theme, palette, sidebar, default model, window geometry, restore toggles
```

- `settings.json` is user-editable and parsed as JSONC (comments allowed). It stores app appearance, window bounds/state, and the `restore` toggles.
- `workspace.json` is auto-managed and debounced (300 ms) with an atomic temp+rename write and a generation guard. It records project paths, tab titles/logos, the split tree, per-pane cwd, input drafts, command history, and selected agent models/session ids.
- Scrollback is written separately (on close, quit, and every 30 s while dirty) so the debounced hot path stays small. Restored panes spawn a fresh shell in the saved cwd and seed the previous buffer above the new prompt.
- Agent transcripts are appended as raw events and replayed through `push_chat_event`, so the restored UI matches the previous session exactly. Embedded sessions reopen their durable session id. Historical OMP sessions restore their transcript.
- Window geometry is loaded synchronously before `open_window`, validated against the current displays, and saved on close/quit.
- Legacy v1 `workspace.json` files (including the old `com.Markup.Markup` location) are backed up to `<data>/backups/` and migrated automatically.

Environment overrides: `KATHAMO_DATA_DIR=/absolute/path` (derives config/state/logs from it) and `KATHAMO_DISABLE_RESTORE=1` (clean launch without reading saved state).

### 2.6 Embedded rpi agent (`agent/`)

The pi-rust v0.21.0 library crates and CLI sources are vendored as a Git subtree
under `agent/` and kept as its own Cargo workspace. Non-build upstream assets
(website, docs, scripts, packaging, deploy/demo, CI metadata and most examples)
were removed after import; `examples/plugin-stub` remains as a test fixture.
Kathamo path-depends on `agent/crates/rpi-embedded`, a host-facing library built
from the upstream library crates.

- **Default backend.** `src/agent_bridge.rs` opens one `EmbeddedSession` per rpi
  conversation. The session owns a dedicated multi-thread Tokio runtime and
  reuses upstream's `rpi_cli::session::build`: model/credential resolution,
  built-in `read`/`bash`/`edit`/`write`/`docs` tools, the coding system prompt,
  durable JSONL session storage and `AgentHarness`.
- **Typed transport.** A dedicated host emitter retains shared tool snapshots
  before projecting text. Raw and projected queues each allow 256 records /
  4 MiB, admitting one oversized final record exclusively. Async text/lifecycle
  delivery backpressures without blocking runtime workers; intermediate
  identified snapshots can coalesce. GPUI drains 64 records / 256 KiB per pane
  and resignals pending work. The default backend uses no `rpi` subprocess.
- **Lifecycle.** Prompts run on the session runtime. Stop and pane close call
  `request_stop_round` + `abort_reclaiming`, which cancels active tools. A
  stale resumed session id falls back to a fresh durable session.
- **Discovery and login.** Model catalogs and provider readiness are read
  in-process through `rpi_embedded::catalog`/`providers`. rpi-only API-key and
  OAuth logins are driven in-process through the embedded provider configuration.
- **Baseline.** The old subprocess bridge is retained behind
  `KATHAMO_RPI_BACKEND=rpc` for before/after measurements. The default is the
  embedded backend. `KATHAMO_STREAM_TIMINGS=1` reports startup, UI drain/apply,
  render, markdown parse and tool arrival→card/output percentiles for both.
- **Isolation.** Embedded sessions build with `no_extensions` because upstream
  extension identity is process-global. Built-in tools/providers, `models.json`,
  `auth.json`, environment credentials and session storage are reused.
- **Content search.** The built-in `grep` embeds ripgrep's matcher and searcher.
  Native searches stream files on a blocking worker and discover directories
  incrementally, retaining ignore rules, deterministic breadth-first ordering,
  cancellation and bounded output without an external `rg` process.
- **Shell execution.** `tokio::process::Command` runs Bash/PowerShell with
  concurrently driven stdin, stdout, stderr, status, cancellation and deadlines.
  An eight-record output channel feeds a bounded tail and complete asynchronous
  log spool. First output is immediate; subsequent UI checkpoints use one
  execution-local 16 ms timer, including quiet periods. Timeouts do not add a
  post-reap sleep. Interrupted/dropped calls clean up their process groups.
- **Interactive PTYs.** `terminal::pty_session` owns setup, resize, termination,
  reaping and handle destruction off GPUI, using the existing smol pool and
  worker-only deferred I/O. One FIFO writer bounds accepted/in-flight input to
  32 MiB / 4,096 frames. Submission pacing starts after physical-write receipts;
  refusals/failures remain visible and retain drafts. Parser/restoration batches
  stay at most 128 KiB and yield between batches. Reader EOF is not a fake child
  exit code.
- **Persistence and RPC.** Conversation fields are capped before copying into a
  256-entry / 8 MiB writer queue; overload/disk failures surface in chat.
  Optional RPC spawn/restart/kill/wait/join run on lifecycle workers, not GPUI.

timings, dependencies, file inventory and remaining limits.

See `EMBEDDED_AGENT.md` for the upstream commit, integration details, verification
and remaining limitations.

### 2.7 Native Gemini API

The embedded model catalog registers `google/gemini-3.8-flash`. The Rust
OpenAI-compatible HTTP transport sends requests to Google's Gemini API,
streams text and reasoning, and carries Gemini thought signatures through
tool calls and history. The host uses the embedded before-tool-call hook to
ask for approval before running tools other than file reads and searches.
The separate `google-antigravity` provider uses Cloud Code Assist streaming and
registers Gemini 3.8 Flash, Claude Sonnet 4.6, and the Gemini Flash-Lite models,
so a congested 3.8 route can be swapped for a faster one without changing
providers. The embedded login worker performs OAuth with PKCE over a loopback
redirect, discovers the account's project, and renews its credential from the
local Antigravity auth store. The provider reuses the same event batching and
tool approval path as the public Gemini API.

### 2.8 Native provider catalog and authentication

`rpi-runtime::catalog` embeds a frozen, MIT-licensed provider/model snapshot from
Oh My Pi revision `73d7521269a1212fc2b2790a2e8c08424496c953`, unioned with
Kathamo's existing identities. Provider endpoints, wire APIs, capabilities and
credential environment aliases are native Rust metadata; no OMP code executes.
Explicit `models.json` configuration retains precedence. Server/account model
discovery supplies real model IDs for dynamic providers.

`rpi-embedded::catalog()` exposes every catalog identity; `chat_catalog()` is the
agent picker surface. Non-chat model metadata remains available through
`rpi-runtime::catalog::model_metadata`. Unsupported non-chat/auxiliary protocols
cannot block resolution of unrelated chat providers.

`rpi-cli::native_auth` implements browser PKCE, device grants, provider-specific
sign-in and token renewal using the same atomic `auth.json` store as inference.
Native and extension OAuth refreshers compose without replacing extensions.
Capability lookup is side-effect-free on the UI thread; extension capabilities
are discovered in the background and cached per project. Cloud requests acquire
AWS SDK credentials or Google ADC at request time, not during local discovery.
